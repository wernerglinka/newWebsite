        ## What I do
        My name is Werner Glinka, a front-end developer based in Minneapolis, MN. I have a strong sense for design, speak the language of designers and respect their decisions and requests. Design firms and companies with internal design resources are my clients. I like to build JAM Stack sites, Gatsby and Metalsmith are my favorites because they are super fast and secure. However, for many clients I have build Wordpress sites. I also build fully functional templates for applications.
